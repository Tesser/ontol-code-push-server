# CodePush Server

The CodePush Server is a Node.js application that powers the CodePush Service. It allows users to deploy and manage over-the-air updates for their react-native applications in a self-hosted environment.

Please refer to [react-native-code-push](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push) for instructions on how to onboard your application to CodePush.
